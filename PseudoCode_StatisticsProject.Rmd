#### Question 1: Evaluating the effect of three different new antibiotics on growth of E. coli in lab cultures.

* Load ggplot2 for graphing.
    + Import data from "antibiotics.csv" file.
    + Create a box plot of "Antibiotic Type" vs. "E.coli Growth" using ggplot2.
* Look at antibiotic treatments on the growth of E. coli using an ANOVA-design linear model and likelihood ratio test.
    + Assign a value to the absence of antibiotic treatment (0) and the presence of antibiotic treament (1) - we will need a 3-column matrix that will assign a "1" to each of the different antibiotic treatments in a different column. The control will always be "0".
* Define our negative log likelihood functions
    + One for the null model.
    + One for the linear mode.
* Run null and linear negative log likelihood models. 
* Conduct the likelihood ratio test.
* Store and print results.

#### Question 2: Evaluating the effect of sugar concentration on growth of E. coli in lab cultures

* Load ggplot2 for graphing.
    + Import data from "sugar.csv" file.
    + Create a scatter plot of "Sugar Concentration" vs. "E.coli Growth" using ggplot2 with a trendline.
* Define our negative log likelihood functions
    + One for the null model (growth of the E. coli is the same regardless of the sugar concentration).
    + One for the linear model.
* Run null and linear negative log likelihood models. 
* Conducted a likelihood ratio test.
* Print results.

#### Question 3: Statistical Power Analysis (Regression vs. ANOVA)

##### Regression-designed Experiment

* Create data based on given parameters.
    + Create two empty data frames to store x and y matrices of variables.
    + Randomly select 24 x-values between 0-50.
    + Calculate the corresponding y-values based on a linear equation (m = 0.4 and b = 10).
    + Run 10 monte carlos of this data using for-loops.
    + Add noise to the data with 8 sigma values (1,2,4,6,8,12,16,24).

* Run data through a null model.
* Run data through a linear model.
* Perform a likelihood ratio test.
    + Average p-value across monte carlos.

##### ANOVA-designed Experiment (2,4, and 8 level)

* 2-level ANOVA
    + Create two experimental trials to be 13 and 38 with 13 set as control variable. 
    + Calculate y-values from a linear equation.
    + Add noise to the data with 8 sigma values (1,2,4,6,8,12,16,24).
    + Run data through a null model.
    + Run data through a linear model.
    + Perform a likelihood ratio test.
    + Store and print results.
    
* 4-level ANOVA
    + Create four experimental trials to be 10, 20, 30, and 40 with 10 set as the control variable.
    + Calculate y-values from a linear equation.
    + Add noise to the data with 8 sigma values (1,2,4,6,8,12,16,24).
    + Run data through a null model.
    + Run data through a linear model.
    + Perform a likelihood ratio test.
    + Store and print results.
    
* 8-level ANOVA
    + Create eight experimental trials to be 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 with 5 set as the control variable. 
    + Calculate y-values from a linear equation.
    + Add noise to the data with 8 sigma values (1,2,4,6,8,12,16,24).
    + Run data through a null model.
    + Run data through a linear model.
    + Perform a likelihood ratio test.
    + Store and print results.

* Assess the ANOVA vs regression-design performance.
