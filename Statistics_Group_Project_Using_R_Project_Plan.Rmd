### 11/27/2017: 

+ Keith created a repository in Github and added Libby and Chelsea as collaborators.

+ Started the plots for questions 1 (antibiotics effects on growth of E. coli) and 2 (sugar effects on growth).

+ These were then compiled into a dated R-markdown document to keep track of progress. The most up-to-date code is in the R-markdown sheet.

### 11/29/2017:

+ Start looking at antibiotic treatments on the growth of E. coli using an ANOVA-design linear model and likelihood ratio test.

+ Start testing for an effect of sugar concentration on growth of E. coli using a regression-design linear model and likelihood ratio test.
